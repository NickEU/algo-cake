# Write a function that takes an integer flightLength (in minutes)
# and a list of integers movieLengths (in minutes)
# and returns a boolean indicating whether there are two numbers
# in movieLengths whose sum equals flightLength.

#When building your function:

#Assume your users will watch exactly two movies
#Donâ€™t make your users watch the same movie twice
#Optimize for runtime over memory
