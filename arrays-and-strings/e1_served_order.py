#I have two registers: one for take-out orders,

#where they should be handled first-come, first-served.

#INPUT:
#The take-out orders as they were entered into the system
#and given to the kitchen. (takeOutOrders)

#The dine-in orders as they were entered into the system
#and given to the kitchen. (dineInOrders)

#as it was finished by the kitchen. (servedOrders)

#Given all three lists, write a function
#to check that my service is first-come, first-served.
